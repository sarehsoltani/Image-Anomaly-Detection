## Image Anomaly Detection

Detecting anomalies in images is a popular application of anomaly detection.
In this tutorial, we will go over a popular dataset known as the "[MVTec Anomaly Detection](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad)" dataset. MVTec is a dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection methods with a focus on industrial inspection.

Here are some features of the dataset:

*   Contains over 5000 high-resolution images.
*   Images are divided into fifteen distinct object and texture categories such as bottle, cable, carpet, wood, leather and pill.
*   Each category consists of two sets: training images (defect-free) and test images (with defects and without defects).


Some example of the MVTec dataset:
